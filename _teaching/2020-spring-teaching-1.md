Course Overview
======

The course devotes each session to a specific technology, algorithm or platform that influences the marketing industry: from clustering, to collaborative filtering or natural language processing. Each session is a mix of theory and practice. During the first half of the session we review the existing technologies and their applications to the marketing field. The second half of each session is practical so students can test and apply the learnings acquired during the first half to real marketing situations using the R programming language.
